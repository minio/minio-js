###  Developer Guidelines

``minio-js`` welcomes your contribution. To make the process as seamless as possible, we ask for the following:

* Go ahead and fork the project and make your changes. We encourage pull requests to discuss code changes.
    - Fork it
    - Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
    - Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')
    - Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
    - Create new Pull Request

### Style Guide

We are currently migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript, so **All Source should be written in [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)**

That means only use nodejs `require` in js config file like `.eslintrc.js`

You should always fully specify your import path extension,
which means you should write `import * from "errors.ts"` for `errors.ts` file, do not write `import "errors.js"`.
